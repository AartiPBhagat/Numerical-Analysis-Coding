# Numerical-Analysis-Coding

This repo has 2 subfolders:
1. Numerical-analysis using C programming
2. Numerical-analysis using FORTRAN

It contains coding for different numerical analysis methods,
* Iterative methods :  Newton-Raphson method, Lagrangian interpolation, Inverse interpolation
* Methods for differential equation solution : Runge-Kutta 4th order method, Runge-Kutta 2nd order method
* Numerical Integration methods: Simpson’s 1/3rd rule, Simpson’s 3/8th rule, Trapezoidal rule
